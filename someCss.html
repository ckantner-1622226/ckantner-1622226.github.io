<p class="first">Last year marked the 100th anniversary of the founding of Bauhaus. 
More than a design aesthetic, Bauhaus was a movement, with its school contributing to an era of thought leadership that shaped our modern world. 
The founding principles of Bauhaus lauded function: the idea that design should scale and serve society. That impact is still felt today in the way we teach the practice of design. 
Bauhaus led to the creation of disciplines like industrial design and product design, focusing on peopleâ€™s needs as a way to inspire form.</p>

<p class="second">Now that 2019 has come to a close, I challenge the industry in 2020 to move into a meta-modernist approach: to redesign design itself through education. 
In 1919, the founders of Bauhaus were responding to a profound change in society and culture where industrialization changed everyday lives at an unprecedented scale. 
They believed something was missing: that in exchange for productivity, we lost art, humanity, and nature.</p>
